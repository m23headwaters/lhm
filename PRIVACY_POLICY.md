# Privacy Policy for LuxHome

**Last Updated:** June 15, 2025

**Disclaimer:** This is a policy for our beta app. We are committed to protecting your privacy, but this policy may be updated as our services evolve.

This Privacy Policy describes how LuxHome ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of our mobile application (the "App").

### 1. Information We Collect

We collect information you provide directly to us, information generated through your use of the App, and information from third-party services.

* **Account Information:** When you register, we collect personal information which may include your full name, email address, phone number, and a profile photo. Your user role (Client, Property Manager, or Admin) is also stored.
* **Property Information:** To provide our services, we collect and store details about properties, including street address, city, state, and zip code, as well as property-specific notes.
* **Service Request Information:** When you submit a service request, we collect the service type, a description of the issue, and any images you choose to upload. All communications, notes, and photos added to a service request are stored.
* **Vendor and Subcontractor Information:** For Property Managers, we collect information about vendors, including their name, contact details (email, phone), company name, and service types.
* **Third-Party Integrations:**
    * **Google Sign-In:** If you sign up or log in using Google, we receive information from your Google account, such as your name and email address, to populate your profile.
    * **Google Calendar:** If you are a Property Manager or Admin and you connect your Google Calendar, we access your calendar list to facilitate service scheduling. We store encrypted authentication tokens to maintain this connection. Assignments between your calendars and clients are also stored.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

* Provide, operate, and maintain the App.
* Manage user accounts and facilitate communication between Clients, Property Managers, and Subcontractors.
* Process and manage service requests.
* Assign subcontractors to service requests and schedule appointments.
* Create and manage calendar events related to service requests if you have connected your Google Calendar.
* Communicate with you, including sending service-related notifications and responding to support inquiries.

### 3. How We Share Your Information

Your information is shared in the following ways to enable the App's functionality:

* **Between Clients and Property Managers:** A Client's contact information, property details, and service requests are shared with their assigned primary and secondary Property Manager(s). A PM's contact information is visible to their assigned clients.
* **With Subcontractors/Vendors:** When a service request is assigned, relevant details may be shared with the assigned subcontractor to facilitate the service.
* **Third-Party Service Providers:** We use Firebase (a Google service) for backend infrastructure, including authentication, database (Firestore), and file storage (Firebase Storage). Your data is stored on Firebase servers. For more information, please see the [Firebase Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).
* **As Required by Law:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

### 4. Data Storage and Security

We are committed to protecting your information. We use Firebase, a secure and scalable platform, for our backend services. Data such as Google Calendar authentication tokens are encrypted before being stored in our database. While we implement robust security measures, no system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

### 5. Your Choices

You can review and update your account information at any time through the Profile screen in the App. You may also disconnect your Google Calendar integration from the Profile screen. To request account deletion, please contact our support.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App.
